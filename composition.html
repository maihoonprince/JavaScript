    <p>Composition in JavaScript refers to the practice of building complex functionality or objects by combining simpler functions or objects. 
        
        <br>It's a fundamental concept in modern JavaScript development and is closely related to the principles of modularity and reusability.

            <li>Functional Composition</li>
            <li>Object Composition</li>
            <li>Component-Based Architecture</li>

            <p>Composition is a powerful concept that promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. It encourages building software systems by assembling smaller, self-contained pieces, whether they are functions, objects, or components, rather than relying heavily on monolithic structures or inheritance hierarchies.</p>
